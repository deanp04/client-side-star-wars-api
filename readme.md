# Star Wars Encyclopedia
This is the client-side interface to fetch JSON from a REST API I created which contains Star Wars character data.

**Try the App:** https://starwarsdata.netlify.app/

## How It's Made: 

**Tech used:** HTML, TailwindCSS, CSS, JavaScript

I had fun challenging myself to figure how to render the API data in the modals within the html and make the interface visually appealing.

It was a lot of fun to create my own REST API that I wanted to create a user interface for folks to interact with it. find the API code at: https://github.com/deanp04/star-wars-api 

## Next Steps for this Project
Expand the API and add more features to the client side interface.

## Examples:
Take a look at these other projects that I have in my own portfolio:
